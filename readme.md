# Centered Set Inference for AI Alignment

## Overview

This repository contains research (and hopefully soon some prototype code) on applying centered set theory to AI alignment, fine-tuning, and adaptation. The core idea is to move beyond traditional "bounded set" approaches to AI alignment (which draw fixed boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable outputs) toward a "centered set" approach that focuses on directional alignment toward core values. It could theoretically work alone or in conjunction with the traditional "bounded set" approaches to better replicate the human ideal of having both values and rules as guides to behavior and work product.

## The Concept

In a centered set approach to AI alignment:

- Instead of defining rigid boundaries of acceptable behavior, we define a "center" consisting of core values or ideals
- The AI's outputs are evaluated based on how close they are to this center and in which direction they're moving
- Alignment becomes a continuous process where the model aims to decrease the distance between its behavior and the ideal center
- The "center" can be adjusted over time as human values evolve, making this inherently a dynamic alignment approach

This approach could help create AI systems that:
- Adapt more gracefully to evolving ethical values and user needs
- Navigate complex trade-offs between different values (like helpfulness vs. safety)
- Provide more nuanced responses instead of defaulting to refusals when near boundaries
- Maintain alignment even in novel situations not seen during training

## Why This Repository Exists

I'm sharing this research to invite collaboration and feedback. As a systems thinker who works with patterns, I've developed this conceptual framework but lack:

1. The technical expertise to implement all the nuanced details
2. The resources to test and iterate on implementations
3. The specialized knowledge to determine how this approach would interact with current AI alignment techniques

My hope is that by making this research public, others with complementary skills and resources might find value in these ideas and help develop them further.

## Background

I've been researching this concept for months, trying to develop the necessary skillset to implement it. However, I realized that waiting until I had all the expertise might take years, and I wanted to see what others think of this approach now.
